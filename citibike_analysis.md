# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This analysis was based on New York City's Citi Bike bike-sharing program data with the purpose of determining if this is a business format that would also work in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Aspects taken into consideration
What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## Analysis
Younger riders tend to take longer trips than the older ones. In addition to taking longer trips, younger users also tend to use the bike service more often than older ones. According to the Census Bureau, the percentage of youger population in Des Moines (24,50%) is higher than that of NYC (20.90%).

The more touristic areas of NYC show higher bike usage than the more residential neighborhoods. However, even though NYC welcomes a lot more tourists than Des Moines does, most riders might be local residents, judging by the vast majority of users being annual subscribers, compared to short-term riders.

Rush hours have the highest utilization rates: users might use bikes to commute to and from work, or to complete their commute and get closer to their final destination.

Des Moines is not as well served by public transportation as NYC, so having the shared bike service as an option, particularly around the downtown area, could prove to be a success.
